# wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual blueprint of a user interface, showing the layout and basic structure of a web page, app, or software screen. It outlines where key elements like buttons, images, text, and navigation will appearâ€”without focusing on colors, fonts, or detailed design.

Layout Structure

Defines the overall organization of the page or screen.

Helps visualize where elements like headers, sidebars, footers, and main content areas will be placed.

Ensures consistency across screens and supports responsive design planning.

Navigation

Shows how users will move through the interface (e.g., menus, tabs, links).

Helps plan the user journey and information hierarchy.

Critical for ensuring intuitive and efficient interaction.

Content Placement

Specifies the locations of key content such as text blocks, images, videos, and calls to action.

Helps identify content priorities and space allocation.

Allows stakeholders to confirm that important messages are visible and accessible.

Functionality

Indicates interactive elements like buttons, input fields, sliders, and drop-downs.

Represents how users will interact with the system.

Ensures designers and developers understand required behaviors before building.
