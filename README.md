# wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual blueprint of a user interface, showing the layout and basic structure of a web page, app, or software screen. It outlines where key elements like buttons, images, text, and navigation will appearâ€”without focusing on colors, fonts, or detailed design.
