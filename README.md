# wireframing

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual blueprint of a user interface, showing the layout and basic structure of a web page, app, or software screen. It outlines where key elements like buttons, images, text, and navigation will appear—without focusing on colors, fonts, or detailed design.

Layout Structure

Defines the overall organization of the page or screen.

Helps visualize where elements like headers, sidebars, footers, and main content areas will be placed.

Ensures consistency across screens and supports responsive design planning.

Navigation

Shows how users will move through the interface (e.g., menus, tabs, links).

Helps plan the user journey and information hierarchy.

Critical for ensuring intuitive and efficient interaction.

Content Placement

Specifies the locations of key content such as text blocks, images, videos, and calls to action.

Helps identify content priorities and space allocation.

Allows stakeholders to confirm that important messages are visible and accessible.

Functionality

Indicates interactive elements like buttons, input fields, sliders, and drop-downs.

Represents how users will interact with the system.

Ensures designers and developers understand required behaviors before building.

Types of Wireframes.

Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, rough layouts used early in the design process to focus on structure and user flow.
 high-fidelity wireframes are detailed, polished designs used later to show visual elements, content, and interactions closer to the final product.

 High fidelity

 Figma is a powerful, browser-based design tool widely used for wireframing, UI/UX design, and prototyping. It allows teams to collaborate in real-time, making it ideal for remote work and feedback cycles. Key features include drag-and-drop components, vector editing, interactive prototyping, and design system management. 

 From a software development perspective, wireframing offers several key benefits:

Clarifies Requirements Early — Wireframes help developers and stakeholders visualize the product’s structure and functionality before coding begins, reducing misunderstandings.

Saves Time and Costs — Identifying design issues and workflow problems early prevents costly changes during development.
